Project to find the longest game of Age of Empires played by the Legend Rus

On the 5th of July T90 Official Uploaded a video to YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dswXJ4w_Sfw) 
wherein he undertook to cast a game of Age of Empires played by the Legend Rus
that is longer than the current record (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zN_LAbFaoM) which was 
13 hours in-game time, if he reaches 2k5 subs or something.

We therefore need to, as suggested by dfhwze in the comments, find the longest game of Age of Empires played by the legend Rus.

## Setup
Rus currently uses Selenium webdriver. To use selenium, you will need to:
1. Install Chrome or Firefox
2. Install a driver for Chrome of Firefox 
3. Put the driver into your path
